                            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                                <p><strong>William Blake</strong>, although not appreciated during his lifetime, has been very influential to the modern world.  His writings have been read and reread for many years.  All of these readings have produced various interpretations.  These different interpretations are what make these writings so interesting and important to modern culture.  One of Blake’s works that was revolutionary is his “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.”  In an essay entitled “Why Blake Wrote about the Bible,” Clark Waggoner comments on how Blake “subverts (Heaven and Hell) and creates a whole new mythology of the relationship between the eternal forces set in authority over man in the Bible.” In essence, this is exactly what Blake was trying to do by writing this controversial piece.</p>
                            <h1>Body</h1>
                                <p>Waggoner talks about how Blake uses the “Proverbs of Hell” to explain to us what exactly Hell is like.  He quotes various proverbs to show examples of the differing beliefs of Heaven and Hell.  One in particular is “He who desires but not acts, breeds pestilence.”   Heaven’s version of this is to not act upon desire but instead to keep it restrained.  Waggoner says that Blake is not trying to prove that Satan and God are any different than what they are usually taken as (good and evil) but rather that the coexistence of the two should be further analyzed and understood.  His other great point about Heaven and Hell comes from his comments on the proverb: “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.”  He makes a wonderful point that there is truth to this statement even though it is the radically opposed to what is widely accepted to be true. Waggoner’s argument about how Blake uses the “Proverbs” as a way to explain to the reader what Hell is actually like has a lot of validity.  Blake himself says this in the section prior to the “Proverbs.” <em>“As I was walking among the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius; which to Angels look like torment and insanity, I collected some of their Proverbs: thinking that as the sayings used in a nation, mark its character, so the Proverbs of Hell, show the nature of Infernal wisdom better than any other description of buildings or garments”</em> Blake says here that it is the laws and beliefs of a nation that describe what it is like, not its streets or its physical makeup.  There is so much truth in this statement and it is proven throughout “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.”  Another example of how the “Proverbs” clearly show the reader what hell is like is the last proverb.  “Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ’d.”  This proverb is saying a lot about Hell.  Inhabitants of Hell have come to the realization that there is no point in speaking the truth all the time if no one is going to believe it.  This is an interesting and very pessimistic point about telling the truth.  This really gives us a clear picture of who inhabits Hell and why they are there.  These people have come to believe that even if you tell the truth, people aren’t always going to believe you so there is no reason to tell the truth in the first place. From these Proverbs we get a better understanding of Hell but we also gain a wonderful insight into how Heaven and Hell and God and Satan almost need each other in order to exist.  Waggoner does not go into detail about this but it is very apparent.  Waggoner states that The Proverbs take up about a fifth of the entire poem but does not realize how actually important this is to what Blake is trying to do.  “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” is trying to take the two of the biggest rivals of all time and put them together in the same “place.”  The Proverbs do this in the most direct way.  They are all the exact opposite of the classic proverbs of the Bible that we know.  This extreme difference shows us that without Hell, Heaven would not exist and vice versa.  This is clear because without a Hell of eternal damnation, why would anyone strive to be virtuous and “good” so that they can go to Heaven?  Also, if people did not have the choice to be “bad” instead of “good” then there would be no need for a Heaven.  This choice comes from the existence of the virtues of Hell shown in these Proverbs of Hell.  And these virtues of Hell come from the existence of the virtues of Heaven.  This is a cycle but it clearly shows how Heaven needs Hell to exist and vice versa. Waggoner makes great points on the differences between Heaven and Hell and from where these differences come.  One thing he failed to talk about that could have strengthened his argument is the Devil’s description of Jesus.  He says various things concerning the Ten Commandments and how, from his perspective, Jesus broke them.  He finishes this critique with a great line: <em>“I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments: Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.”</em>  This line so affects the Angel listening that he embraces the devil and later actually becomes a devil.  This example of the difference between Heaven and Hell stems solely from perspective.  From Heaven’s point of view, the Ten Commandments are something that should never be broken and that Jesus followed these all the time.  As said in this Devil’s speech, the Ten Commandments would not exist if they were not first broken.  Further, he goes on to say that Jesus did not follow the rules.  He brings up various times that he did such as when he did not answer Pilot concerning whether he was the son of God and when he stopped the men from stoning the women who committed adultery.  Both of these are examples of when Jesus did not follow or agree with the Ten Commandments.  When this happened, Jesus’ followers turned a blind eye towards it. Waggoner makes another point about the generalities associated with both Heaven and Hell.  He says how heaven is associated with good and hell is associated with evil.  Furthermore, as Blake says, good is “the passive that obeys Reason” while “Evil is the active springing from Energy.”  Waggoner touches on the idea that these differences revolve around the idea of contraries and that “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” itself revolves around contraries as well.  He elaborates on this by telling us that the poem’s most famous line is “Without Contraries is no progression.” Heaven is the Good in the world and Hell is Evil.  Blake explicitly says this and Waggoner agrees.  When Waggoner says, “Without Contraries is no progression” is the poem’s most famous line he fails to mention this line’s importance to the core ideas of the poem.  The title of “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” is controversial in itself.  Blake is taking two places about as different as black and white and he is merging them into one.  He is not doing this to cause uproar; rather he does this to illustrate a very interesting point about the world in which we live.  He is showing that without variance, we cannot dream of ever improving our lives as well as the world in which we live.  He proves this time and time again in “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” as well as in his other works.  William Blake was a Romantic and Romantics believed that conformity was ruining their world and they warned people against it.  Here, instead of warning people against conformity, he is, instead, proving why variance and these differences are needed in order for our world to progress.  He proves it over and over again in “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” with lines such as his comments on Jesus and the Ten Commandments.  What he is trying to say is that if we truly want to progress as a species we cannot expect us all to be the same.  If we were all the same, we would never differ in opinions and nothing would ever sprout.  This relates back to the point about Heaven and Hell both needing each other.  By juxtaposing these two opposites, Heaven and Hell, to one another, Blake shows that it is indeed the co-existence of these types of extremes that allows for us to advance our culture.</p>
                            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                                <p>William Blake takes an idea, the afterlife that is probably one of the most debated topics of his time, and uses it to show why we need diversity among our society.  Waggoner breaks Blake’s “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” down into in its components and makes some brilliant observations.  It is not what a place is made up of but rather its beliefs that make it what it is.  Also, “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” comments on how without variety we are doomed to a stagnant society that has little or no progress.  It is through the co-existence of extremes that we can have any hope in ever allowing our culture to evolve and progress.</p>
