                            <h1> Introduction </h1>
                                <p>It can always be said hindsight is 20/20. This idea is, of course, that, with respect to some event or occurrence, in retrospect we can nearly perfectly state what actually happened. Some of the more interesting views using hindsight are those reflecting on events that occur during the times of crisis, and <strong>John B. Taylor</strong> offers us just this perspective in <em>Getting Off Track</em>. In <em>Getting Off Track</em>, Taylor speaks on the problems of Government interaction during the Economic troubles faced in this country beginning in 2007 and 2008. Taylor provides an analysis and summary of the troubles faced during these times, giving the reader an understandable idea of what happened during this crisis, as well as why it happened and why it was prolonged. The causes and continuance of the crisis during this time has been highly debated, with a number of opposing arguments from book to book. Using some monetary and financial economics, Taylor offers his argument as to the causes of the crisis with some convincing points, coming from the man who fathered the macroeconomic Taylor Rule. Taylor offers a short and very understandable book to address the problems that would allow for a large array of readers.</p>
                            <h1>Body</h1>
                                <h4> Book Summary</h4>
                                    <p>Taylor breaks his book into 5 chapters, beginning with a description of what caused the financial crisis. The first chapter provides a look into Taylor’s views of what actually caused the financial crisis (again, all of the points made in the book are the opinions and conclusions of Taylor). <strong>Taylor’s main theory is that the crisis was caused by loose fitting monetary policy, and prolonged by an incorrect diagnosis of a liquidity problem, versus the actual risk problem that existed </strong>. Taylor centers this analysis on the Taylor rule, which uses inflation, expected inflation, and GDP to give a recommended interest rate. Although the Taylor rule had been followed in the times before the crisis, at the beginning of the crisis, the Taylor rule was not as tightly tracked.  The federal funds interest rate fell below the Taylor rule recommendation, and the rates led to a housing boom, followed by an inevitable bust. The accelerated housing boom, which was a result of the incorrect rates, raised prices too quickly, and the bust ensued. Some attempted to explain this decrease in rates as a result of a savings glut, but Taylor shows that there is no evidence to support this possibility. To further support the housing theory, Taylor shows that the countries that deviated the farthest from the Taylor rule recommendations experienced the largest changes in housing investment. Furthermore, the housing bubble led to even more problems. The boom and bust brought delinquencies and foreclosures (if the house prices were rapidly decreasing, the owners had less interest in making their mortgage payments), and these subprime mortgages were packaged into mortgage-backed securities. People were unable to identify which mortgages were the riskiest within these pooled securities, as the risk was combined. The risk on the balance sheets of banks was not as people believed it to be, and this all led to the problems that were faced. Again, these interest rates were lower than recommended, leading to a spike in housing prices. This rapid spike quickly led to a bust, which, as we will see, created a number of resulting problems.</p>
                                    <p>In the second chapter, Taylor discusses what might have prolonged the crisis. From here on in the book, Taylor begins to use a Libor-OIS spread to analyze the problems that were showing up, thus prolonging the crisis (Libor is the London Interbank Offered Rate and OIS is Overnight Indexed Swap). The OIS helps to control for rate expectations, so looking at the spread allows for more analysis into the specifics of risk and liquidity effects on the interest rates. Taylor plots this spread, and in August of 2007, right before the start of the crisis, there is a severe jump in the graph. This means that the spread stays much higher than the average prior to the crisis, and Taylor suggests that this jump in the spread has a “contractionary” effect on the economy, meaning recession type effects. Other economists, and even the Government, thought the original problem to be liquidity. However, Taylor, using the Libor-OIS spread, argues, rather, that it was a counterparty risk problem. Taylor looked at the spread of unsecured loans and secured interbank loans with the same maturity. This spread gives some idea of the risk premium contributions, and what Taylor found was that this spread was highly correlated with the Libor-OIS spread. The high correlation signaled that it was indeed a counterparty risk problem, and the prolonging of the crisis, according to Taylor, was due to three interventions. These interventions either did not address the problem, or had unintended consequences.  The first was the Term Auction Facility, or TAF. The TAF was meant to make it easier for banks to borrow money, by allowing banks to directly bid for funds from the Fed. The TAF clearly addressed a liquidity problem (that may have not existed according to some economists). A drop was shown in the Libor-OIS spread, but very soon after the spread was on the rise again. The second intervention that did not work was the Economic Stimulus Act, which provided some temporary cash infusions in an attempt to jumpstart the economy. Consumption, however, did not spike with the spike in available income. Finally, there were the cuts in the interest rates in 2008. The Taylor rule recommendations called for rate cuts, but not as sharp as the ones performed. Each intervention did not address the risk problem, by either addressing liquidity, or by introducing some monetary move that ended with no effect at all.</p>
                                    <p>The third section of the book looks at why the crisis, a year in, worsened dramatically. The previous chapter had talked about the prolonging of the crisis, but in the third section, Taylor argues that more Government intervention, like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, could have possibly led to more risk. The fourth chapter references back to prior crises, mainly the Great Moderation period beginning with problems in the mid to late 1970’s, and the many crises throughout the 1990’s. Taylor uses a “Mission Impossible” approach to analyze these problems, proposing the problem to the Fed or another similar organization in hopes of getting it solved. The first consisted of problems with high inflation and high GDP volatility. In order to combat these, Taylor argues that monetary policy was used to lower inflation and GDP volatility with the rational expectations method, which is explained later in this review. The second crisis, or rather a series of crises, existed with the many emerging countries (that is, emerging economies) in the 1990’s. There were 8 years of crises, and it was evident that the frequency and global spread of financial crises needed to be reduced. In this analysis, Taylor used the spread between the interest rates of the countries minus US Treasury spreads in order to measure risk. The crisis was indeed ended eventually (Taylor attributes this to policy changes). The only other notable point was the need of the International Monetary Fund (the IMF) to change to be more predictable. This did indeed happen, as the IMF introduced the Exception Access Framework, which stated explicitly new policies of the IMF, to do just that (again, increase predictability). Taylor references a third Mission Impossible, but does not spend much time on it, or even offer a solution. Taylor attempts to relate all of these problems to the 2007 crisis; mainly pointing out that these types of problems had been explicitly solved in the past.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, in the last chapter, Taylor analyzes the indicators of counterparty risk, contributing to the economic problems of 2007 and 2008, versus liquidity as the cause. Taylor also examines the possibility that banks wanted to look better in the end of year reports by having safer assets on their balance sheets. He goes back to the Libor and the early signs of the risk problem shown through it, as well as using the Libor-OIS as a diagnostic tool to examine interest rate premiums. Taylor compares three measures with the Libor-OIS to show risk; credit default swaps, the Libor-Tibor spread, and Libor-Repo spreads. Credit default swaps measure the probability that banks default, the Tibor (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) allows us to compare rates to a bank not affected by US actions, and the Libor-Repo accounts for backed securities. Each of these three intuitively allow us to look at more controlled measures of risk. These three deal highly with counterparty risk, and showing their correlation with the Libor-OIS supports the counterparty risk argument. In the end of the book, Taylor answers frequently asked questions about different terms and rules used in his arguments.</p>
                                <h4> Analysis </h4>
                                    <p>Overall, it seems most helpful to summarize Taylor’s views on the economic crisis of 2007 and 2008 on the basis of the Taylor rule and counterparty risk. He believes that the federal funds rate should have followed the Taylor rule recommendations (the rule is now a widely accepted macroeconomic principle, but his nonetheless). With counterparty risk, Taylor argues strongly that the initial problem was wrongly diagnosed as a liquidity problem, as opposed to a counterparty risk issue. In terms of the Taylor rule, Taylor would be wrong here if the surroundings at that time did not satisfy the requirements (which are briefly examined later on) for the use of the Taylor rule. With the counterparty risk versus liquidity issue, it may not be debated that counterparty risk was some of the problem, but it seems possible that liquidity was also a contributing factor. After all, we did see a drop in the Libor-OIS spread after the introduction of the TAF. The TAF targeted liquidity, and the TAF did initially have a helpful effect.</p>
                                    <p>There are several issues to consider when determining the accuracy of Taylor’s counterparty risk argument. First off, we can take a look at the possibility of the Taylor rule not being fitting for the time. Athanasios Orphanides has been noted for giving a criticism of the Taylor rule.  He points out that the Taylor rule is based on data, and when monetary decisions are being made, the data is real time, and often with a lot of noise. This makes it difficult to fit it correctly to a model when policy makers are deciding what to do when faced with a current problem (Orphanides, 8). Taylor partly addresses this idea in the frequently asked questions part of the book. He claims that the rule was not meant for forecasting, rather it was meant to be normative. He then claims that it turned out to be positive as well as normative. Moving onto Taylor’s idea of counterparty risk being the problem as opposed to liquidity, it would be interesting to look at the short time after the TAF was introduced. As shown through Taylor’s graphs, the time period after the TAF led to a decrease in the Libor-OIS spread, before the spread went on the rise again. The thought that the spread rose again holds some ground for the counterparty risk argument (as the TAF targeted liquidity and did not sustain effects), but there must be some reason that the spread went down after the TAF was introduced. Whether it was an effect uncaused by the TAF, or the TAF actually addressing an existing liquidity problem, there may be some counterargument to Taylor’s points. The short-term success of the TAF gives reason to believe that there were some liquidity problems. This success does not necessarily disprove Taylor’s argument for counterparty risk, but does add the liquidity idea to the table. Taylor never seems to acknowledge any liquidity problem, but it seems that based on the above considerations, it is possible that there was a problem of both. However, the fact that the Libor-OIS spread drops did not sustain with the advancement of time with the TAF may point out and support Taylor’s counterparty risk argument, as it could be proof that counterparty risk was indeed the main problem.</p>
                                    <p>Taylor uses many economic ideas and principles throughout the book to support his argument. We see the Libor-OIS spread, the Taylor rule, interest rate premiums, and the rational expectations method. The first idea Taylor presents is the Taylor rule, and he uses it in order to state the basis of the problem. The Taylor rule gives a recommendation of what the interest rate should be based on inflation, target inflation, and GDP. Again, this is a rule that John Taylor himself proposed, so it is not surprising to see it presented within his book. Taylor then moves onto the Libor-OIS spread. Again, Taylor uses this principle in his book to address what the problem was early on in the crisis. The spread is the difference between the Libor rate and the OIS rate, and allows us to control for expectation effects, and move into different interest rate premiums that we would expect to see. The interest rate premiums that Taylor is interested in are liquidity premiums and risk premiums. These premiums would be the driving factors to the large, unusual spreads that Taylor presents, and they allow us to conceptualize on what the problem may be (Taylor makes a strong point with other spreads that would be specifically risk driven and shows a strong correlation between those and the Libor-OIS). These rate premiums basically say that a higher interest rate is demanded if there is some hindering aspect like reduced liquidity or higher risk. These things would force the lender to desire a higher return in order to compensate dealing with these problems. Finally, the expectations hypothesis just says that rates depend on market participants’ expectations, and is only briefly used by Taylor when talking about the problems dealt with before the Great Moderation. Taylor bases much of his argument on the counterparty risk and insolvency, and these are the heaviest and most used principles throughout the book.</p>
                                <h4> Other Reviews on the Book </h4>
                                    <p>As we have John B. Taylor himself writing a book on the crisis, it is expected that a number of critics would read and react to the book, and we see many reviews as a result. Jerry H. Tempelman gives us his view on the book. Tempelman overall agrees with the book, enjoying its briefness and the amount of merit it’s arguments have, but offers some points that may have been ignored by Taylor. First, it is pointed out that Taylor’s argument “ignores the fact that mortgage interest rates tend to be priced off long-term U.S. Treasury yields, which the Federal Reserve neither targeted nor controlled at the time, rather than off the federal funds rate, which it does.” Tempelman also points out that the analysis of rising energy prices could have also been due to the times of war and terrorism (Tempelan 1). The review agrees with many of Taylor’s points, but addresses that the extreme brevity of the book may be a downfall in fully evaluating the problems. In another review by Clive Crook, the briefness of the book is again addressed as a downfall. Crook points out that things like the sub prime mortgage problem do not get enough attention and description, and Taylor mainly sticks to addressing the problem of the Fed and their decisions (Crook). Overall, these arguments against Taylor hold relatively well. Indeed, Taylor makes strong points with data to support them, but the shortness of the book alone would allow us to infer that there is something missing before we even open to the first page. One of the books pros (the accessibility in its simplicity and brevity to all readers) also proves to be one of its biggest cons.</p>
                            <h1> Conclusion </h1>
                                <p>One notable feature about this book, compared to the other 2007 crisis books, is that Taylor does not explicitly give a recommendation for moving forwards. Taylor spends most of the time analyzing the problems that triggered the crisis as well as what went amiss, and little time giving much of an outlook in the future. He shortly addresses it in his FAQ section, but little attention is given to the topic otherwise. Even in his third “Mission Impossible”, Taylor gives little description or advice on a crisis that had occurred just a few years before this 2007 crisis. He ends the chapter proposing the mission, and that is all. If we were to go back and take the advice of Taylor by first following the Taylor rule, we may not be in such a large crisis. Also, if the problem had originally been addressed as a risk problem, not liquidity, the prolonged crisis may have been averted. Taylor makes the comparison of wrongly diagnosing a medical patient to what happened with the liquidity-risk issue. Indeed, an incorrect diagnosis can make the actual problem worse. <strong>Taylor’s data and arguments do hold merit </strong>, and if we were able to go back, the situation could have unraveled differently. But, going back to the idea of hindsight being 20/20, it is easy to say all of these things now. <strong>Taylor provides a short, useful summary of the events </strong>. He voices his oppositions to the steps taken to intervene on the crisis, and provides readers with a methodological explanation.</p>
